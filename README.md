# goWordPressXML2HTML 

This code is for a converter that converts WordPressXML into HTML that enables it to be fed into Pandoc to enable the content from WordPress posts to be available for Pandoc. 

# Notes

The code currently relies on a fork of the go-wordpressxml library ( "github.com/grokify/go-wordpressxml" ) 

The system is similar to the Python program - https://github.com/Petess/wordpressXML2HTML

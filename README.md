# goWordPressXML2HTML 

This code is for a converter that converts WordPressXML into HTML that enables it to be fed into Pandoc to enable the content from WordPress posts to be available for Pandoc. 

# Notes

The code currently relies on a fork of the [go-wordpressxml library ](https://github.com/grokify/go-wordpressxml) 

The system is similar to the Python program - [wordpressXML2HTML](https://github.com/Petess/wordpressXML2HTML)
